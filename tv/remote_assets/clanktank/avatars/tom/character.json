You can participate in the fair launch and earn $SPACE by depositing stETH and contributing your yield to the $SPACE/ETH liquidity pool on Base, and 7 days after depositing stETH you can withdraw it anytime, keeping 100% of your principal.\n\nYou can also trade $SPACE directly on nounspace from the $SPACE token space: https://www.nounspace.com/t/base/0x48C6740BcF807d6C47C864FaEEA15Ed4dA3910Ab\n\nRecently, nounspace launched a space for every token on Base and Polygon that the owner/creator of the token can customize. By default, each space includes market data, free swaps, live chat that can be token gated, key links, and a feed of all mentions of the token on Farcaster. Next, we look forward to bringing this same functionality to AI Agents to give every agent a feature-rich space they can customize themselves."
